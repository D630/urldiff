       FAIL 2014-02-12_15:43 URL: $url does not match
       NEW 2014-02-12_15:43 URL: $url
        file://${urldiff}/diff/53e4a875ad5c7ea306cccf991f2768f7_diff.txt
        file://${urldiff}/cache/53e4a875ad5c7ea306cccf991f2768f7.html

NOTES
       路   You can write all commands and options without masking -. So,
           instead of -help you may use help.

       路   Urls in the url list need to be seperated by newline.

       路   To check the connection status, <google.com> will be
           pinged. If you do not like that, modify it please.

CONFIGURATION
       Set following variables in the third section of the script:
              urldiffdir=DIR (needed)
              urllist=FILE (needed)
              mailto=<MAILTO> (optional)
